I'm a Seattle native that has been spending the last few years in Philadephia, completing medical school. I'll be starting my career as a surgical intern this July at Lankenau Medical Center. My next adventure after that is going back to Seattle to complete my residency in interventional radiology at the University of Washington! 

This blog is a way for me to share some of my thoughts about the process of medical education/training, my experiences as a newly-minted doctor, and the constant struggle of work/life balance. 

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, lounging on sandy beaches, cooking, and hanging out with [Michael](https://www.michaelsobrepera.com "Check out Michael's website") (my wonderful fiance), Abita (golden retriever), and Diana (maine coon).
