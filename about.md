I'm a Seattle native that has been spending the last 6 years in Philadephia, completing medical school at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University and a surgical internship at Lanekanu Medical Center. My next adventure is completing an integrated residency in interventional radiology at the University of Washington! 

This blog is a way for me to share some of my thoughts about the process of medical education/training, my experiences as a newly-minted doctor, and the constant struggle of work/life balance. 

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, lounging on sandy beaches, cooking, and hanging out with [Michael](https://www.michaelsobrepera.com "Check out Michael's website") (my wonderful husband), Abita (golden retriever), and Diana (maine coon).
