Hi there! Welcome to my blog! This is a place where I'll be posting my ramblings on life, work, and everything in between. I'll start by introducing myself. I'm a soon-to-be physician starting May 2019. I'm currently living in Philadelphia and the photo shown on this post is one of my favorite streets in the city. I am an interventional radiologist-in-training and will be spending the next year at Lankenau Medical Center as a surgical intern before moving to Seattle to complete my residency. I feel like this year has been a whirlwind and now that I have some vacation time post-Match Day (wooo!), I wanted to make a blog to document the things that are going on and also hopefully provide some helpful information about being in medicine.
